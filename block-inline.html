    <h2>block-level elements</h2>
    <p>block level elements are those that create  a block formating context.<br>
     they are typically start on a new line and take up the fil width of their parent container
    </p>
    <div>this is a block-level <strong>div</strong>elements</div>
    <p>
     a common property of block-level elements is that they stack vertically.<br> each block level element starts on a new line below the previous one
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>item1</li>
        <li>item2</li>
        <li>item3</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>inline level element</h2>
    <p>
        inline-level element,on the other hand, do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.they flow within the context.side by side
    </p>
    <p>an example of an inline -level element is the <stonng>strong</stonng> element.
    it make text <strong>bold</strong> without starting a new line</p>
    <p>inline element can appear <em>within</em>block-level elements,such as paragraphs and headings.
    this allows for inline staying and markup within larger content blocks.</p>
    <h2>mixed use</h2>
    <p>html documents often contain a mix of block-level and inline-level elements to structure content effectively for example,you might
        use headings(h1,h2) as block-level elements to define section of a page and then us inline-level elements like 
        <strong>strong</strong>and<em>emphasized</em>text within those sections
    </p>
